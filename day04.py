# 8.1 Make an English-to-French dictionary called e2f and print it.
# Here are your starter words: dog is chien, cat is chat, and walrus is morse
e2f = dict(dog = 'chien', cat = 'chat', walrus = 'morse')
print(e2f)

# 8.2 Using your three-word dictionary e2f, print the French word for walrus.
print(e2f['walrus'])

# 8.3 Make a French-to-English dictionary called f2e from e2f. Use the items method.
f2e = dict()
for english, french in e2f.items():
    f2e[french] = english
print(f2e)

# 8.4 Print the English equivalent of the French word chien.
print(f2e['chien'])

# 8.5 Print the set of English words from e2f.
print(set(e2f))

# 8.6 Make a multilevel dictionary called life. Use these strings for the topmost keys:
# 'animals', 'plants', and 'other'. Make the 'animals' key refer to another dictio‚Äê
# nary with the keys 'cats', 'octopi', and 'emus'. Make the 'cats' key refer to a list
# of strings with the values 'Henri', 'Grumpy', and 'Lucy'. Make all the other keys
# refer to empty dictionaries.
life = dict(animals = {'cats': ['Henri', 'Grumpy', 'Lucy'], 'octopi': ' ', 'emus': ' '}, plants = ' ', other = ' ')

# 8.7 Print the top-level keys of life.
print(life.keys())

# 8.8 Print the keys for life['animals'].
print(life['animals'].keys())

# 8.9 Print the values for life['animals']['cats'].
print(life['animals']['cats'])

# 8.10 Use a dictionary comprehension to create the dictionary squares.
# Use range(10) to return the keys, and use the square of each key as its value.
squares = {key : (key * key) for key in range(10)}
print(squares)
